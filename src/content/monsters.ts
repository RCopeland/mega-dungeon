These jointed snakes are the size of a normal cobra, and follow commands given to them or programmed into them by their creators. Bronze cobras are not as lethal as iron cobras, being made of softer metal and having a five-dose supply of paralysis poison (3d6 turns) rather than a three-dose supply of lethal poison. They are, however, faster than the similar mechanism created from iron.",
