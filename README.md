## Adventure Scenario

![Adventures Investigating a Trash Heap, generated by DALL-E](https://github.com/rcopeland/mega-dungeon/mainline/src/assets/the-scrape.min.jpeg)

Outside town, there is a massive pit called Tren'tar, but locally, its referred to as *The Scrape*. This is where all
the waste generated by a town ends up, tossed over the edge. That's the idea though, for a hundred years, the
giant heap of trash grows smaller, some say at the bottom there's a giant machine that burns it, others guess that 
it's continually slipping into an even larger cave system.

In the last few weeks however, the pile has stopped shrinking. 

## Info

This is a lower-level adventure, intended for use with [Old School Essentials](https://necroticgnome.com/).

### Cold Open

The adventures have already agreed to investigate, and are standing on top of the trash mound. They notice
the stink first, followed by just how unstable a pile of garbage is to stand on.
Looking down and around the heap, the PCs can see shadowy areas where the base of the mound meets the gorge walls.
If they brave a closer look, the team will discover a locked stone door.

### DM Background Info
<details>
  <summary>Spoilers!</summary>

  The trash heap and complex below were originally built by Gnomes (a hundred years ago) to solve the mounting trash problem. 
At the bottom of the heap is a large chamber where trash continually falls and is consumed and dissolved 
by a dozen [Gelatinous Cubes](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Gelatinous_Cube).
  A month ago, something happened that lured the cubes away from their station, living beings infiltrated 
the complex. The cubes, on instinct, opt to pursue the fresh meat rather than subsist on trash.

// TODO: what infiltrated the complex?
