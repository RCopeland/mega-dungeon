# MegaDungeon

TODO

- [x] figure out some kind of image map for the rooms
- [x] set up a token you can drag around
- [ ] store token location
- [ ] make the tokens position relative (responsive)
- [ ] write the room content
- [ ] style the room info component (maybe a set position instead of following the cursor?)
